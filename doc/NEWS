  Path to ftp(1) defaults to /usr/bin/ftp on NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD
  and DragonFlyBSD.  On other systems it defaults to tnftp from
  pkgsrc.

  FTP_OPTIONS and WGET_OPTIONS default to "-4" for using IPv4 only.

  New configuration variable IGNORE_CKSUMS was added in order to
  ignore SHA512.txt absent in some repositories.

======================================================================
Version 0.7.2, by Aleksey Cheusov, Mon, 13 Jun 2011 22:44:31 +0300

  Fix for "Package xxx is not found" problem:

       0 > nih -y install editors/emacs20
       ...
       0 > nih -y install editors/emacs22 emacs-
       Package editors/emacs22 is not found
       1 >

======================================================================
Version 0.7.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Tue, 17 May 2011 00:19:50 +0300

  Subcommand "list" was implemented. See manual page for details.

  Output format of "install|update", "meta" and "list" subcommands can
  be changed by user in configure file.

  "pkg install" and "pkg_update_summary".
  Prefixes was replaced with suffixes.
    prefix -    =>   suffix -
    (none)      =>   suffix -- (remove with dependent packages)
    prefix +    =>   suffix +
    prefix ?    =>   suffix _
    prefix *    =>   (removed)

  Clean-ups in "nih install" output. New default format of the output.

  Fix: "nih clean-cache" fails if there are no binaries in cache
  directory.

  Program pkg_status becomes a part of pkgnih. pkg_status package is
  no longer needed.

  "nih remove" was reimplemented using "nih install" =>
  "pkg_delete -A" is not used anymore =>
  automatically installed leaf packages are removed correctly.

  Thanks to Zafer Aydogan for his testing and a lot of suggestions!

======================================================================
Version 0.6.4, by Aleksey Cheusov, Tue,  5 Apr 2011 01:03:20 +0300

  @prefix@/sbin/pkg_add is used instead of just pkg_add.
  This fixes a problem under NetBSD (with default PATH) where
  /usr/sbin/pkg_add doesn't support flag -D needed by nih.

  ~/.nih is created in the very beginning.
  This fixes 'cd: ~/.nih: No such file or directory' problem
  on fresh systems.

======================================================================
Version 0.6.3, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat,  2 Apr 2011 00:51:22 +0300

  pkg_update_plan:
    - Better algorithm for resolving devendencies.  First, DEPENDS and
      CONFLICTS are analysed. Then PROVIDES/REQUIRES.  This fixes the
      problem with multiple packages with different name that PROVIDES
      the same shared library.
    - Fix (unicity problem)
    - Better error message for "l:" failures

  nih:
    - Fix (package with highest version per (PKGPATH, PKGBASE) was not
      detected correctly in some situations)

======================================================================
Version 0.6.2, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 20 Mar 2011 16:14:28 +0200

  Workaround for buggy /bin/sh on DragonFly and FreeBSD<=7.n.
  On these systems  the following code
    set -e; if eval false; then ...; fi; echo ok
  doesn't work properly. Due to this problem nih almost always fails.
  On these two platforms you also need pkg_online-client>=0.12.1
  for 'nih search -o', 'nih info -o' and 'nih meta -o'.

  Another bug was fixed in pkg_update_plan. It caused "unicity
  problem" when package upgrade is requested.

  'pkg_add -D' is used for installing packages in order to temporarily
  (during installation process) ignore unsatisfied dependencies.

======================================================================
Version 0.6, by Aleksey Cheusov, Mon, 14 Mar 2011 15:18:05 +0200

  Bug in handling flag "automatic" was fixed in pkg_update_plan(1).
  Update pkgnih to 0.6 is recomended!

  etc/nih/conf:
   - Default settings have been moved from share/examples/nih/nih.conf
     to lib/nih/nih.default.conf. Almost empty nih.conf is installed
     to share/examples/nih/nih.conf. Please update your existing
     etc/nih/config according to share/examples/nih/nih.conf.
   - Two new variables were added to nih config file: FTP_OPTIONS and
     WGET_OPTIONS for specifying extra arguments for ftp(1) or
     wget(1) commands.
   - variable PKG_SUMMARY_URL has been renamed to REPOSITORY
   - Default value for variable REPOSITORY is correct for DragonFlyBSD
     and Minix.

  New command "nih meta" was implemented that outputs meta packages.
  See the manual page for details.

  Since this release "nih install" accepts file names of binary
  packages in additiona to PKGBASEs, PKGNAMEs and PKGPATHs, for
  example
       # nih install    /path/to/file/binary-1.2.3.tgz
       # nih install   +/path/to/file/binary-1.2.3.tgz
       # nih install '*'/path/to/file/binary-1.2.3.tgz
       # nih install '?'/path/to/file/binary-1.2.3.tgz

  Manual page for pkg_update_plan was added.

  nih.1 was updated

  "nih install" uses field FILE_NAME if it is provided by
  pkg_summary.txt

======================================================================
Version 0.5, by Aleksey Cheusov, Wed, 16 Feb 2011 23:38:20 +0200

  Yet another bug in pkg_update_plan introduced in 0.3.0
  was fixed (packages were marked as auto-removable incorrectly).

  Better algorithm for detecting potential problem was
  implemented. Now it checks PROVIDES/REQUIRES consistency and uses
  this information for automatically resolving problems.

  Also, packages with unchanged version but inconsistent changes in
  CONFLICTS/DEPENDS/PROVIDES/REQUIRES are now handled correctly.

  Minor fixes and updates in documentation.

======================================================================
Version 0.4.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 13 Feb 2011 00:54:56 +0200

  Fix bug in pkg_update_plan introduced in 0.4

======================================================================
Version 0.4, by Aleksey Cheusov, Fri, 11 Feb 2011 16:40:36 +0200

  Fix bug in pkg_update_plan
  (extra -pkgname were needed for upgrade).

  nih status:
    - New option -B was added for considering packages different
      if their BUILD_DATE differ.

  nih install:
    - New option -B was added for considering packages different
      if their BUILD_DATE differ.
    - New option -D was added for debugging purposes.

======================================================================
Version 0.3.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 16 Jan 2011 23:01:21 +0200

  Fix in generating an "update plan".

  Command "nih info" was added. It shows an information about packages
  in the repository or about installed packages. See a manual page for
  details.

  nih clean-cache:
    - New option -i was added that takes into account
      ~/.nih/installed_*.txt files.

  nih deps:
    - Option -z has been replaced with -I. By default, pkg_summary.txt
      is analysed, not installed packages just like in "nih search"
      and "nih info".

  "nih verify", "nih status -s" and other commands that don't require
  pkg_summary.txt now work normally without "nih refresh" and even
  without binary repository (without pkg_summary.txt) at all.  Thanks
  to Andrey N. Oktyabrski for pointing out about these problem.

  Unless NO_SUMMARY_COPY variable is set in configuration file,
  downloaded pkg_summary.txt and SHA512.txt files are copied to
  "pkg_summary_YYYYMMDD_hhmm.txt" and "SHA512_YYYYMMDD_hhmm.txt"
  respectively, thus allowing to restore and use them in the future.

  Unless NO_INSTALLED_COPY variable is set in configuration file,
  ~/.nih/installed_YYYYMMDD_hhmm.txt file containing a list of
  installed packages before removal/installation is created thus
  allowing to restore the previus state of the system.

  yes_* variables were introduced in config file for always answering
  "Yes" to particular questions.

  fix: "nih search -r" without -3|-9 options doesn't fail with strange
  error messages anymore.

  Minor fixes in nih.conf

======================================================================
Version 0.2.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Mon,  3 Jan 2011 19:01:56 +0200

  First publicly available release.
