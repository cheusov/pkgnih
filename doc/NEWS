Version 0.5, by Aleksey Cheusov, Wed, 16 Feb 2011 23:38:20 +0200

  Yet another bug in pkg_update_plan introduced in 0.3.0
  was fixed (packages were marked as auto-removable incorrectly).

  Better algorithm for detecting potential problem was
  implemented. Now it checks PROVIDES/REQUIRES consistency and uses
  this information for automatically resolving problems.

  Also, packages with unchanged version but inconsistent changes in
  CONFLICTS/DEPENDS/PROVIDES/REQUIRES are now handled correctly.

  Minor fixes and updates in documentation.

  Fix in generating an "update plan".

  Command "nih info" was added. It shows an information about packages
  in the repository or about installed packages. See a manual page for
  details.

  nih clean-cache:
    - New option -i was added that takes into account
      ~/.nih/installed_*.txt files.

  nih deps:
    - Option -z has been replaced with -I. By default, pkg_summary.txt
      is analysed, not installed packages just like in "nih search"
      and "nih info".

  "nih verify", "nih status -s" and other commands that don't require
  pkg_summary.txt now work normally without "nih refresh" and even
  without binary repository (without pkg_summary.txt) at all.  Thanks
  to Andrey N. Oktyabrski for pointing out about these problem.

  Unless NO_SUMMARY_COPY variable is set in configuration file,
  downloaded pkg_summary.txt and SHA512.txt files are copied to
  "pkg_summary_YYYYMMDD_hhmm.txt" and "SHA512_YYYYMMDD_hhmm.txt"
  respectively, thus allowing to restore and use them in the future.

  Unless NO_INSTALLED_COPY variable is set in configuration file,
  ~/.nih/installed_YYYYMMDD_hhmm.txt file containing a list of
  installed packages before removal/installation is created thus
  allowing to restore the previus state of the system.

  yes_* variables were introduced in config file for always answering
  "Yes" to particular questions.

  fix: "nih search -r" without -3|-9 options doesn't fail with strange
  error messages anymore.

  Minor fixes in nih.conf
