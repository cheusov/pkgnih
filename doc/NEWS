Version 0.6.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 20 Mar 2011 16:14:28 +0200

  Workaround for buggy /bin/sh on DragonFly and FreeBSD<=7.n.
  On these systems  the following code
    set -e; if eval false; then ...; fi; echo ok
  doesn't work properly. Due to this problem nih almost always fails.
  On these two platform you also need pkg_online-client>=0.12.1
  for 'nih search -o', 'nih info -o' and 'nih meta -o'.

  Another bug was fixed in pkg_update_summary. It caused "unicity
  problem" when package upgrade is requested.

  'pkg_add -D' is used for installing packages in order to temporarily
  (during installation process) ignore unsatisfied dependencies.

Version 0.6, by Aleksey Cheusov, Mon, 14 Mar 2011 15:18:05 +0200

  Bug in handling flag "automatic" was fixed in pkg_update_plan(1).
  Update pkgnih to 0.6 is recomended!

  etc/nih/conf:
   - Default settings have been moved from share/examples/nih/nih.conf
     to lib/nih/nih.default.conf. Almost empty nih.conf is installed
     to share/examples/nih/nih.conf. Please update your existing
     etc/nih/config according to share/examples/nih/nih.conf.
   - Two new variables were added to nih config file: FTP_OPTIONS and
     WGET_OPTIONS for specifying extra arguments for ftp(1) or
     wget(1) commands.
   - variable PKG_SUMMARY_URL has been renamed to REPOSITORY
   - Default value for variable REPOSITORY is correct for DragonFlyBSD
     and Minix.

  New command "nih meta" was implemented that outputs meta packages.
  See the manual page for details.

  Since this release "nih install" accepts file names of binary
  packages in additiona to PKGBASEs, PKGNAMEs and PKGPATHs, for
  example
       # nih install    /path/to/file/binary-1.2.3.tgz
       # nih install   +/path/to/file/binary-1.2.3.tgz
       # nih install '*'/path/to/file/binary-1.2.3.tgz
       # nih install '?'/path/to/file/binary-1.2.3.tgz

  Manual page for pkg_update_plan was added.

  nih.1 was updated

  "nih install" uses field FILE_NAME if it is provided by
  pkg_summary.txt

Version 0.5, by Aleksey Cheusov, Wed, 16 Feb 2011 23:38:20 +0200

  Yet another bug in pkg_update_plan introduced in 0.3.0
  was fixed (packages were marked as auto-removable incorrectly).

  Better algorithm for detecting potential problem was
  implemented. Now it checks PROVIDES/REQUIRES consistency and uses
  this information for automatically resolving problems.

  Also, packages with unchanged version but inconsistent changes in
  CONFLICTS/DEPENDS/PROVIDES/REQUIRES are now handled correctly.

  Minor fixes and updates in documentation.

Version 0.4.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 13 Feb 2011 00:54:56 +0200

  Fix bug in pkg_update_plan introduced in 0.4

======================================================================
Version 0.4, by Aleksey Cheusov, Fri, 11 Feb 2011 16:40:36 +0200

  Fix bug in pkg_update_plan
  (extra -pkgname were needed for upgrade).

  nih status:
    - New option -B was added for considering packages different
      if their BUILD_DATE differ.

  nih install:
    - New option -B was added for considering packages different
      if their BUILD_DATE differ.
    - New option -D was added for debugging purposes.

======================================================================
Version 0.3.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 16 Jan 2011 23:01:21 +0200

  Fix in generating an "update plan".

  Command "nih info" was added. It shows an information about packages
  in the repository or about installed packages. See a manual page for
  details.

  nih clean-cache:
    - New option -i was added that takes into account
      ~/.nih/installed_*.txt files.

  nih deps:
    - Option -z has been replaced with -I. By default, pkg_summary.txt
      is analysed, not installed packages just like in "nih search"
      and "nih info".

  "nih verify", "nih status -s" and other commands that don't require
  pkg_summary.txt now work normally without "nih refresh" and even
  without binary repository (without pkg_summary.txt) at all.  Thanks
  to Andrey N. Oktyabrski for pointing out about these problem.

  Unless NO_SUMMARY_COPY variable is set in configuration file,
  downloaded pkg_summary.txt and SHA512.txt files are copied to
  "pkg_summary_YYYYMMDD_hhmm.txt" and "SHA512_YYYYMMDD_hhmm.txt"
  respectively, thus allowing to restore and use them in the future.

  Unless NO_INSTALLED_COPY variable is set in configuration file,
  ~/.nih/installed_YYYYMMDD_hhmm.txt file containing a list of
  installed packages before removal/installation is created thus
  allowing to restore the previus state of the system.

  yes_* variables were introduced in config file for always answering
  "Yes" to particular questions.

  fix: "nih search -r" without -3|-9 options doesn't fail with strange
  error messages anymore.

  Minor fixes in nih.conf

======================================================================
